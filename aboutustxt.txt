Welcome to The Origin Thai,
Born from the heartfelt desire to share the rich and vibrant flavors of Thai cuisine with the Smithfield community. <br><br>


Our dishes are lovingly crafted by a passionate female chef, blending authentic recipes with a touch of modern creativity. <br><br>


Inspired by the dream of a lively, welcoming bar, we’ve also partnered with a skilled female bartender to create unique drinks in a space full of character and charm. <br><br>


Whether you’re here for a cozy meal that feels like dining with family, or a joyful evening with friends, The Origin Thai is here to welcome you with warmth, flavor, and heart. <br><br>


We hope to become your favorite spot — a place you’ll always want to come back to.
